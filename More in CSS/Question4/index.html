    <p>Maharana Pratap was the son of Maharana Udai Singh of the Sisodiya clan of Rajputs, the rulers of Mewar. Pratap became the ruler of Mewar against his fatherâ€™s wish, who had appointed his favourite son Jagmal as his successor. However, the senior nobles of Mewar decided that Pratap, the first son and rightful successor should be crowned king. Moreover, Maharana Pratap was said to be a man of strong Rajput character, he was far more brave and chivalrous. His kind heartedness and just decision making won the hearts of even his enemies. He is the only ruler of India that did not give in to the Mughal rule, and for that he is the most celebrated ruler of the country to this day.</p>
